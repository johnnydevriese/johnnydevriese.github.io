There are loads of great resources to learn nowadays. Here's a list of sites that I've found useful.

# JavaScript
* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
This book has a great introduction to not only JavaScript but numerous computer science topics.

# Python
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html)
If you already have programming experience this is a great way to see how things are done in Python.

# AWS 

# Big Data & Machine Learning


# Physics
* [Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)
Learn from the eminent Dick Feynman. From classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. His lucid teaching style is a fantastic supplement to most modern texbooks.
