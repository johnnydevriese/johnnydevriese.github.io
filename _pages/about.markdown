Hi, my name is Johnny ~~Minor~~ Devriese. I graduated in spring 2017 with a B.S. in Physics from Washington State University.
I'm always interested in learning about bleeding edge technologies, scientific computing to solve physics problems, and I'm also an avid landscape photographer.

Nowadays, you'll probably find me hacking on building some project, going on adventures with my lovely wife, or riding my bike.

My Wife and I opted for the path less traveled when we chose to move to Boise, ID. People are always curious why we could
choose Boise over the PNW big brothers like Seattle or Portland.
After a wonderful internship at Buildpulse Inc. in 2016 we just decided we weren't a great fit for the hustle and bustle fo the big metropolis areas.
After graduation we moved to Boise and haven't looked back since.
