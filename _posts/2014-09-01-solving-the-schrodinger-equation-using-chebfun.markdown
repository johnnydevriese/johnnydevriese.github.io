My first introduction to scientific computing was working with [Jared L. Aurentz][jared-github].
Over the summer of 2014 we worked on developing an algorithm in C, Python, and eventually Matlab
to solve the Schrodinger and then calculate the hyperpolerizatbility of with the given potential.

You can read through Jared's write brief write-up through Oxford's research group [Chebfun website][chebfun-writeup].


I hope to put my significantly longer write up along with all of the code on GitHub soon!

Here's a plot from Wikipedia of the first five chebyshev polynomials.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
