Despite the directions in the google drive they don't actually work because `composer` wants a `composer.json` file which doesn't get created when we do: 
`$ brew install composer`. All it does is creates a `composer.lock` file. And then when we try to use composer to install all of our projects dependencies which it would 
usually get from our `composer.json` file (much like npm's `package.json` file) it can't find any! Well, we can just create one and copy/paste our dependencies into it and then all will, once again, be right in the world. 

Install composer with brew: 
`$ brew install composer` 
You can check the install with: 
`$ composer -V` 

create a composer.json file within project directory ( ~/Sites/fxptouch/ ): 
`$ vim composer.json` 

I went into to github and copy/pasted the `composer.lock` contents into our new `composer.lock` file. 
(use `:wq` to exit vim. :D )

Now, we can run `$ composer install` which will go through and install all the dependencies. 
Now we'll have a /bin/ directory (before we didnt). `cd` into it and then give phantomjs read/write priviliges with. 
`$ chmod 777 phantomjs` 

go and get your reporting on.
